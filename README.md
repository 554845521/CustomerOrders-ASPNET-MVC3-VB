CustomerOrders_ASPNETMVC3
=========================

Example application using [ASP.NET Mvc3][1] and [Dapper][2].  Adapted from a [Spring.NET example application][3].  Written in VB 10 and distributed under the [Apache license version 2][6] 
    
The example uses stored procedures created for a [MySQL][5] implementation of the Northwind database.  As impractical as they are, this is just an example application and serves the purpose.

TODO:
* [Xunit][4] test examples
* Actually use the .NET 4 routing conventions...
