=============================
CustomerOrders-ASPNET-MVC3-VB
=============================

Example application using [ASP.NET Mvc3][1] and [Dapper][2].  Adapted from a [Spring.NET example application][3].  Written in VB 10 and distributed under the [Apache license version 2][6].
    
The example uses stored procedures created for a [MySQL][5] implementation of the Northwind database.  As impractical as they are, this is just an example application and serves the purpose.   Please [enable NuGet Package Restore][7] to build with the necessary dependencies.

TODO:
* [Xunit][4] test examples
